[(code)code] - Code in parantheses is the code before the specified peice of code I want to refer to.

[ roblox-player: ]
  This is an URI (send request to open the roblox client from a website)
  The "roblox-play" is the name of the HKEY roblox uses, you can find this in regedit (on windows).
  More information about URIs can be found here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa767916(v=vs.85).aspx
  
[ (roblox-player:1)+launchmode:play ]
  I don't know for certainty what the addition sign is actually doing.
  I'll take a guess and assume it's adding on data to be sent to  the ROBLOX Client.
